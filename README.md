# xor_openvpn_bash
Creates a OXR OpenVPN server on Linux.

The benefit of this the fact that you keep your OpenVPN connection while mildly obfuscating the connection making DPI (Deep Packet Inspection) detection less likely so that you are able to use products like Netflix without the "You're using a VPN" popup constantly.

In order to run the software, navigate to the folder in which it was cloned and run the following command:
```
sudo bash main.sh
```
Then follow the onscreen instructions.
